            I am currently a Senior Researcher in the Autonomous Systems group at Microsoft where I focus on the development of robust perception-action loops for safe autonomous systems that can be deployed in the real world. Some of my areas of interest are robot autonomy, representation learning, robust computer vision, and unmanned aerial vehicle technology.<br>
            <br>
            In 2019, received my PhD from the Texas A&M University, where I was part of the Unmanned Systems Lab headed by Srikanth Saripalli. My PhD thesis focused on collaborative localization and uncertainty-aware navigation for groups of micro aerial vehicles. During my PhD, I also worked on applying computer vision and machine learning to autonomous aerial/ground vehicle research, medical robotics, and precision agriculture applications. In the summer of 2016, I interned at NASA Ames Research Center working on unmanned aerial vehicles for subterranean exploration.<br>
            <br>
            Prior to that, I received my MS from the Arizona State University. During these years, as part of the Extreme Environment Robotics Lab, I worked on the design and development of several robotic platforms and sensory networks. One of these robots played a role in the discovery of microbial life in Antarctic subglacial lakes. In 2013, I was an intern in Intel's New Devices team, where I helped build Intel's first biometric headset.
